# RAG-from-scratch-and-PDF-Q-A
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload documents (e.g., offer letters, job descriptions, contracts, research papers etc) and ask natural language questions about them. The system uses FAISS to find the most relevant document sections, then queries an LLM to generate clear and concise answers.
